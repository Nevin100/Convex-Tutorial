# 📚 Convex Tutorial

Welcome to the **Convex Tutorial** repository!  
This project is a hands-on guide where I explored and implemented the **fundamentals of Convex** — a modern backend-as-a-service framework designed for full-stack React applications.

> 🛠 Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **shadcn/ui**.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- 📦 **Convex Backend Fundamentals**
  - Setting up Convex in a Next.js app
  - Understanding and implementing server-side functions
  - Using `mutation` and `query` operations

- ✨ **CRUD Operations**
  - Creating and managing dynamic data using Convex's real-time database
  - Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality with optimistic updates

- 🧠 **Type Safety & Modern Frontend**
  - Leveraging **TypeScript** to ensure end-to-end type safety
  - Clean and modular UI design with **shadcn/ui**

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- ⚡ **Next.js** – React framework for frontend and API routes  
- 🧪 **TypeScript** – Strong typing across frontend and backend logic  
- 🔄 **Convex** – Real-time backend with data layer integration  
- 🎨 **shadcn/ui** – Beautiful, accessible components with Tailwind CSS
